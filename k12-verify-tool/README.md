## 🧠 Intelligent Strategy: K12 Teacher

This tool leverages specific loopholes in K12 verification:

### 1. School Type Targeting
-   **Logic**: Targets schools with `type: "K12"` instead of `"HIGH_SCHOOL"`.
-   **Result**: High probability of **auto-approval** without document upload.

### 2. The "Waterfall" Flow
1.  **Submission**: Submits teacher PII (`collectTeacherPersonalInfo`).
2.  **Auto-Pass Check**: Checks if `currentStep` is `success` immediately.
3.  **SSO Bypass**: Skips school portal login (`DELETE /step/sso`).
4.  **Auto-Pass Check 2**: Checks again for success.
5.  **Fallback**: If upload needed, generates a Teacher Badge.

### 3. Success Factors
-   **Real Info**: Uses real teacher names found on school websites.
-   **IP Address**: Residential/Edu IPs work best.
