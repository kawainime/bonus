## ⚙️ How It Works

### Teacher Verification Flow

```
1. Parse verificationId from URL
2. Generate teacher identity:
   - Name (from name pool)
   - University email
   - DOB (25-55 years old - teachers are older)
3. Generate employment certificate (PNG)
4. Submit → collectTeacherPersonalInfo  ← Different from student!
5. Skip SSO → DELETE /step/sso
6. Upload document → S3
7. Complete → completeDocUpload
```

### Key Difference from Student Tools

| Aspect | Student | Teacher |
|--------|---------|---------|
| API Endpoint | `collectStudentPersonalInfo` | `collectTeacherPersonalInfo` |
| Age Range | 18-25 | 25-55 |
| Document | Student ID Card | Employment Certificate |

## 🧠 Intelligent Strategy: Teacher

This tool is specifically tuned for Teacher verification:

### 1. Teacher Demographics
-   **Age Targeting**: Generates identities aged **25-55** (unlike students who are 18-24).
-   **Employment Proof**: Generates "Employment Certificates" instead of Student IDs.

### 2. The "Waterfall" Flow
1.  **Submission**: Submits teacher PII (`collectTeacherPersonalInfo`).
2.  **SSO Bypass**: Skips school portal login (`DELETE /step/sso`).
3.  **Document Gen**: Creates realistic employment certificates.
4.  **Completion**: Finalizes upload via `completeDocUpload`.

### 3. Success Factors
-   **Valid Schools**: Uses a list of 12+ major universities known to have teacher programs.
-   **Document Clarity**: Certificates are generated with clear, legible text for OCR.
